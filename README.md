# Read Me - Express Server with MongoDB Connection

This is a simple Express server code that establishes a connection to a MongoDB database and listens for incoming requests on a specified port. This code can be used as a starting point for building a RESTful API or any other web application that requires a backend server with database connectivity.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

## Setup
1. Clone or download the code from the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.

## Configuration
- This code uses a `.env` file to store environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following line:

DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<host>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<host>`, and `<database-name>` with your MongoDB connection details. Make sure to replace `<password>` and keep it secure.

## Usage
- To start the server, run the command: `npm start`.
- The server will start listening on port 3030 (can be changed by modifying the `PORT` constant in the code).
- Once the server is running, you should see a message indicating the successful connection to the MongoDB database.

## Adding API Functions
- To add additional API functions, you can define new routes and handlers in the Express app.
- You can create separate files for different routes or add them directly in this file, depending on the complexity of your application.
- Make sure to import the necessary modules and define the routes with appropriate HTTP methods and handlers.

## Notes
- Ensure that the MongoDB cluster specified in the `DATABASE_URL` is running and accessible.
- Remember to secure your `.env` file and never commit it to a public repository as it contains sensitive information.

Feel free to modify and extend this code to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding!
